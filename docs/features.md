# ValueCare Engine & AI Claims Assistant — Feature Layout

## 1. Value-Based Care Automation
- **Outcome Tracking**: Continuously captures chronic care KPIs (e.g., HbA1c trends) from NEHR, HealthHub, and approved wearables through FHIR/HL7 APIs.
- **Protocol Generation**: Converts clinician notes into standardized care plans and protocol checklists aligned with MOH guidelines.
- **Performance Insights**: Surfaces cohort-level improvements, risk adjustment scores, and shared-savings forecasts for clinics and payers.

## 2. AI Claims Assistant
- **Conversation Understanding**: Applies medical ASR and NLU to doctor–patient dialogues to extract diagnoses, procedures, and adherence evidence.
- **Claims Assembly**: Builds payer-ready packets (FHIR bundle or X12 837) enriched with zero-knowledge proof attestations for sensitive data.
- **Coverage Intelligence**: Validates benefit rules, prior-auth requirements, and missing documentation, feeding provider task queues when gaps appear.

## 3. FinTech Layer & Incentive Engine
- **Value-Based Payments**: Supports hybrid reimbursement (risk-adjusted base + outcome bonuses + shared savings) triggered by verified outcomes.
- **Smart Disbursement**: Uses programmable settlement (smart contracts or workflow automation) for instant GP, payer, and patient reward splits.
- **Audit & Compliance**: Maintains MAS-ready logs, consent ledgering, and tamper-evident records for regulatory reporting.

## 4. Governance & Privacy
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Proves outcome improvements without exposing raw PHI, satisfying data minimization and privacy-by-design requirements.
- **Consent Management**: Tracks patient consent lifecycle, data lineage, and access policies across ingestion and analytics layers.
- **Operational Controls**: Implements MAS TRM-aligned monitoring, incident response, and change management checkpoints.

## 5. Platform Operations
- **Unified Ingestion Bus**: Streams structured/unstructured data into a governed lakehouse with encryption-at-rest and in-flight protection.
- **Operational Datastore**: Managed PostgreSQL with JSONB documents for encounters, claim drafts, and consent artefacts, powering transactional flows before they land in the lakehouse.
- **MLOps & Quality**: Provides model lifecycle tooling, drift detection, human-in-the-loop review, and bias dashboards.
- **Provider & Payer Experiences**: Offers clinician consoles for encounter review, payer portals for adjudication visibility, and analytics dashboards for VBC performance.
